# Destiny Solo Report

A Webapp using React and React-Router, currently hosted on [elevatorbot.ch](https://elevatorbot.ch/soloreport/3/4611686018484825875)

## Roadmap

Further down the line, I want to use the local database to make arbitrary rankings of speed, low% etc to give players a feeling of pride and accomplishment.
- Improve general design. Add website logo.
- Make the login button work
- Detect 'fake' raids e.g. less than 20 kills
